# Energy Prediction in Educational Buildings Using BDGE Data Set

## Executive Summary
This project focuses on enhancing energy consumption estimation in educational buildings through advanced machine learning models including LGBM, Random Forest, and Neural Networks. Utilizing the Building Data Genome 2 (BDGE) dataset, this study addresses the complexities of energy prediction, aiming for sustainability and efficiency in energy use within educational facilities.

## Introduction
The goal is to develop a sophisticated method for accurately estimating the total energy consumption, specifically within educational buildings. Given the significant energy usage of educational facilities, this initiative is crucial for enabling informed decisions regarding energy efficiency investments, aligning with global sustainability goals.

## Data
The BDGE dataset, covering energy usage from over 1,000 buildings across two years, served as the foundation for our analysis. The dataset includes building metadata, meter data, and weather information, focusing on the five most prevalent meter types: electricity, chilled water, steam, hot water, and gas.

## Methodology
Our approach began with a thorough data preprocessing phase, followed by exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand energy consumption patterns. Key steps included correcting data types, handling missing values, and applying transformations to normalize the data distribution. The study employed machine learning models such as LGBM, Random Forest, and Neural Networks, with a focus on LGBM for its efficiency and predictive accuracy. Hyperparameter tuning was conducted to optimize each model's performance.

## Results
The LGBM model demonstrated superior performance, with significant R-squared values indicating the model's effectiveness in predicting energy consumption. Predictions for future energy usage were made by aggregating meter readings and calculating total energy consumption for each building.

## Conclusion
The project highlights the potential of using advanced machine learning models for accurate energy consumption prediction in educational buildings. The findings offer insights that can inform energy management strategies, contributing to sustainability efforts within the educational sector.

## Future Research
Future work could explore the integration of real-time data streams, additional contextual variables, and other modeling approaches such as RNNs and SARIMA models to enhance the accuracy of energy consumption forecasts.
