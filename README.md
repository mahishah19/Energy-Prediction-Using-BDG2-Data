## The Building Data Genome 2 (BDG2) Data-Set

### Dataset Description

The Building Data Genome 2 (BDGE) dataset is a comprehensive collection of energy consumption data from over 1,000 buildings, intended for the analysis and prediction of energy usage in educational facilities. Spanning a two-year period, this dataset provides a detailed view of energy dynamics, supporting efforts to enhance sustainability and efficiency in educational buildings. The raw data can be found in https://www.kaggle.com/c/ashrae-energy-prediction/data

### Content

The BDGE dataset consists of three primary components:

Building Metadata: Contains information about the buildings, including their types, locations, and specific characteristics that may influence energy consumption (e.g., floor area, building age, and facility type). 

Meter Data: Includes readings from various energy meters installed in the buildings, capturing consumption data for different types of energy sources - electricity, chilled water, steam, hot water, and gas. The meter data is detailed, showing usage over time, typically recorded on an hourly basis. 

Weather Information: Provides local weather data relevant to the buildings' locations. This part of the dataset includes temperature, humidity, wind speed, and other weather-related variables that can significantly affect energy consumption patterns.
